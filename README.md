RecurrenceHN: Spatial Transcriptomics and Histopathological Analysis of Head and Neck Cancer
This repository contains the computational pipeline and analysis scripts for the study:

**"Spatial transcriptomics and histopathological analyses reveal potential biomarkers and immune features linked to recurrence in head and neck cancer."**

## Project Overview
This study utilizes spatially resolved transcriptomics (10x Genomics Visium and Xenium) to identify molecular markers and immune microenvironment features associated with recurrence in Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). We integrate expert pathologist annotations with high-resolution transcriptomic data to define the spatial landscape of recurrent versus non-recurrent tumors.

## Key Features
- Spatial transcriptome to compare recurrent versus non-recurrent HNC.

- Spatial Differential Expression (DE) Analysis: Identification of markers like PAEP, MARCO, PNPLA3, and FMO2.

- Cross-Platform Validation: Integration with external datasets including TCGA-HNSC, Causer et al. (2023), and Quah et al. (2023).


## Data Availability
The raw and processed spatial transcriptomic datasets, including Visium space ranger output, expert pathologist annotations, and associated metadata, are deposited on Zenodo.
